│	⋯

	The Help is superseded by the instructions below.
	A commercial successor to ARSS is, at the time of writing, actively maintained at http://arss.sf.net.

Installation:
∙	Make modifications to the Makefile to suit your system.
∙	This is configured for Linux with the GCC compiler.
∙	Afterwards, to build, run the following command:
		make && make install
∙	After installing, run arss --help for more information.
∙	The arss.conf file contains an initial configuration.
	The frequency range is set from 27.5 Hertz to 880 Hertz.

Testing:
∙	To generate output for comparison:
	―	run "arss SoulL.bmp",
	―	name the output "SoulL.bmp", and
	―	choose the default settings for everything else.
	Then compare the result SoulL.bmp to Soul.bmp - they should match.
∙	To generate "SoulL.wav" from "SoulL.bmp":
	―	run "arss SoulL.bmp"
	―	name the output "SoulL.wav",
	―	choose "2. Sine synthesis",
	―	choose the default settings for everything else.
	The result, "SoulL.wav", should correspond to "Soul.wav" run through a low-pass filter cut off at 880 Hertz.
