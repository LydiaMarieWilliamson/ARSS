2021 Jun 06:
∙	Packaging and uploading to GitHub.
2020 Oct 12:
∙	Reconsolidation with earlier versions resolved any oversights and losses.
2016 Jun 06:
∙	The local copy of arss.c was accidentally accidentally nuked on this date.
	This is what was archived on 2016 Jan 20, but there may have been changes by 2016 Mar 10.
	However, the original was flawed anyways: the RandomNum() routine needed to be repaired.
	That change was made.
2015 Dec 13: Version 0.3.2
∙	Added dB scales.
2015 Nov 11: Version 0.3.1
∙	Colored the graphs and regularized the options.
2015 Aug 06: Version 0.3
∙	Collation/consolidation of all previous redos and compilation with my version of the FFT, developed in 2012.
∙	Dropped the double real-FFTs in the Analysis routine in favor of a single FFT: real -> analytic -> complex -> magnitude.
∙	Result portable to all hosted platforms with ISO C99 compilers.
2015 Mar 26: Version 0.2.3.3
∙	Third complete redo. Internal version. No compilation or testing done.
	For recoding and removing system/library dependencies.
2014 Feb 09: Version 0.2.3.2
∙	Second complete redo. Internal version. No compilation or testing done.
	For critical review and correction of errors.
2012 Dec 27: Version 0.2.3.1
∙	First complete redo. Internal version. No compilation or testing done.
	Redone layout and code simplification/normalization for analysis, translated to C99.
2008 Dec 17:
∙	The original author dropped the project (which is still on SourceForge) and replaced it by Photosounder.
2008 May 30: Version 0.2.3
∙	Fixed the logarithmic base system so that it produces the expected results when using a different base than 2
∙	Implemented linear frequency scaling
∙	Fixed the volume of noise bands in noise synthesis,
	although it may not be perfect and may be way off for logarithmical bases other than 2 and linear scaling
∙	Implemented bounds checking when reading and writing in the lower and upper frequencies
∙	Fixed the brightness setting input which would only take integer values
∙	Added a bit more information on the progress display line
2008 May 09: Version 0.2.2
∙	Replaced frequency domain windowing by a logarithmic symmetric antiderivative of the Blackman function by a logarithmic Hann function.
	Reduces the visible time domain ripples (which can mainly be seen on the lower part of spectrograms)
2008 May: Version 0.2.1
∙	Fixed a bug in the BMP input function that would shear some images
2008 May 05: Version 0.2
∙	Modified the I/O interface
∙	Added big endian support to the I/O functions
∙	Code clean-up of the I/O functions
∙	Fixed a bug in the BMP input that would cause offsets with certain BMP files
∙	Entirely re-organised the code in a more modular way in order to ease the use of the code as a library
	and to ease up the implementation of new file format support and eventual GUIs
∙	Changed the time measuring function so that results are consistent on all platforms
∙	Implemented fast noise synthesis based on a bank of short filtered noise loops modulated
	with envelopes interpolated using a new technique I named Blackman square interpolation (look-up table based)
∙	Implemented a large number of command-line parameters to allow for scripting,
	front-ends and doing things that couldn't be done before (such as specifying the desired dimensions of a spectrogram)
∙	Automatic selection of the Analysis mode if the input file ends with .wav
∙	Implemented brightness correction
Known bugs:
∙	Drag and drop on Windows changes the current working directory to C:\windows\system32,
	so if you use drag and drop you need to type the full path for the output file or find it in system32.
	A work-around would be to make a simple batch script along the lines of : '"C:\dir\arss.exe" %1'.
0.2 Development Release 2:
∙	Fixed the 16-bit WAVE output bug
∙	Blackman filtering and interpolation for downsizing spectrogram lines
0.2 Development Release 1:
∙	Fast frequency domain full logarithmic scale filtering
∙	Fast FFT-based envelope detection 
∙	Faster analysis (about 100x faster)
∙	Nearest neighbour downsampling for downsizing spectrogram lines (will be changed for the final 0.2 release)
∙	Faster FFT-based sine synthesis method
∙	Noise synthesis disabled (will be re-implemented for the final 0.2 release)
∙	Revision of the user interface
0.1 Release:
∙	Replaced fixed phase sine generation with random phase sine generation
∙	Changed the PRNG
∙	Removed the unused code
∙	Removed every call of nearbyint() due to compatibility issues
∙	Split the project into several files and moved the Makefile creation to CMake
2007 Apr 28 Release:
∙	Image output changed from 16-bit raw to BMP (as it should have been in the first place)
∙	Compiled with Mingw instead of Cygwin so compatibility should be improved
∙	Fixed minor naming mistakes
2007 Mar 25 Release:
∙	Initial release
